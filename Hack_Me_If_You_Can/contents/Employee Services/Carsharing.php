<p>As a organization, we are conscious about protecting the environment. Keeping that in mind, we encourage our employees who commute to our office premises using a motor vehicle to carshare. This portal is built so that you can find a possible car share route for yourself. If you have your own car and would like to share a ride with others, you can post about the route here. On the other hand, you can also book a seat in another car if you find them going through a route which you will also be travelling on.</p>
<p>Kindly remember that carsharing is not a charitable venture from the organization or any employee. So an employee offering his/her car has the right to request some form of monetary payment. Solicitation will be expected. Any complaint in this regards will lead to disciplinary actions if proven right.</p>
