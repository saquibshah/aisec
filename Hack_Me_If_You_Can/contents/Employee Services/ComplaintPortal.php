<p>At our organisation we follow the principle of transperancy. So this portal has been set up as a platform to tell us about your greivances and complaints about any thing and everything you are facing/have faced within this organisation.</p>
<p>This portal lets you write a complaint about anyone within the organisation and because of the transperancy, you are eligible to register this complaint with anyone including our CEO. Kindly understand that registering a complaint means a sensitive situation and requires further investigation. So we will need patience from your end. Also note that a complaint means being responsible. You will have to take responsibility of the complaint and if proven wrong then you will face disciplinary actions yourself.</p>
